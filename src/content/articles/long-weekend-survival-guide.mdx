It's Thursday before Victoria Day weekend and BC Ferries reservations for Friday afternoon are already sold out. You're wondering if you should risk standby or just stay home. Long weekends are chaos, but you can still make it work.

## Why long weekends are so busy

BC Ferries sees capacity spikes of 50-100% during long weekends compared to regular weekends. Everyone has the same idea: escape to the island or head back to the mainland.

**Peak chaos times:**
- **Friday afternoon/evening** - Everyone leaving early
- **Saturday morning** - Late starters heading out
- **Sunday evening** - Day-trippers returning
- **Monday late afternoon/evening** - Long weekend returners

## The golden rule: book reservations early

For long weekends, reservations sell out weeks in advance. Don't wait.

**When to book:**
- Major holidays (Victoria Day, Canada Day, Labour Day): 3-4 weeks ahead
- Thanksgiving: 2-3 weeks ahead
- Last-minute: Check daily for cancellations

**Which sailings need reservations:**
- Friday after 12pm - absolutely essential
- Saturday morning - highly recommended
- Sunday evening - absolutely essential
- Monday afternoon/evening - highly recommended

## Standby strategy for long weekends

If you don't have a reservation (or they're sold out):

### Option 1: Go very early or very late
- **6am-7am sailings:** Usually have standby space
- **9pm-11pm sailings:** Often availability, fewer people want to travel late
- **Very early Saturday:** Before everyone else wakes up

### Option 2: Arrive extremely early
- **Friday:** Arrive 2-3 hours before your target sailing
- **Sunday/Monday return:** Arrive 2+ hours early
- **Be prepared to wait** for multiple sailings

### Option 3: Be flexible
- **Mid-long weekend** Saturday afternoon is often quieter than Friday/Sunday/Monday
- **Tuesday after the holiday** - significantly less busy

## Holiday-specific tips

### Victoria Day (May long weekend)
- **Busiest BC Ferries weekend of the year**
- Book 1 month ahead if possible
- Expect full sailings all weekend

### Canada Day
- **Busy but shorter** (1 day holiday vs 3-day weekend)
- July 1st itself is chaos
- June 30th evening and July 2nd morning see spikes

### BC Day (first Monday in August)
- **Peak summer + long weekend** = very busy
- Already busy season made worse
- Consider going mid-weekend (Saturday) instead of Friday/Monday

### Labour Day
- **End of summer rush**
- Last big camping trip for many families  
- Sunday evening return traffic is intense

### Thanksgiving
- **Busy but manageable**
- Not as intense as summer holidays
- Monday evening return is the worst

## What to bring for long waits

If you're doing standby on a holiday:

- **Snacks and water** - Terminal food is expensive
- **Entertainment** - Books, tablets, cards
- **Patience** - You might wait 2-3 sailings
- **Backup plans** - Hotel options if you don't make it
- **Warm clothes** - Waiting areas can be cool

## Terminal survival

### Tsawwassen & Swartz Bay
- **Arrive fed** - Long lines at food services
- **Use washrooms before boarding lanes** - Less crowded
- **Walk around** - Sitting in car for hours is miserable

### Horseshoe Bay
- **Village options** - Walk to restaurants/cafes if you have time
- **Parking nightmare** - Don't count on finding parking on holidays

## Kids and families

Long weekend ferry travel with kids requires extra planning:

1. **Pack entertainment** - Tablets, books, toys for waiting
2. **Snacks and drinks** - Terminal food is pricey and lines are long
3. **Extra patience** - Crowds and waits will test everyone
4. **Plan activities** - Make the wait part of the adventure
5. **Arrive early** - Stress is worse than boredom

## The contrarian approach

Want to avoid the worst of it?

**Don't travel on the long weekend.** 

The Tuesday and Wednesday after a long weekend are beautifully quiet. If you have flexibility:

- Work Friday, travel Tuesday
- More availability
- Less stress
- Cheaper accommodations (no holiday premiums)
- Actual vacation instead of traffic survival

## Check before you go

Even with a reservation, check:

1. **Your sailing status** - BC Ferries shows current conditions
2. **Weather** - Rough seas can cause delays or cancellations
3. **Service notices** - Unexpected issues happen

And use my [capacity history tool](/) to see how your specific sailing performed on past long weekends.

## Bottom line

Long weekend ferry travel requires planning. Reserve early, arrive early, or be flexible. With the right strategy, you can have a smooth trip even during the busiest weekends of the year.
