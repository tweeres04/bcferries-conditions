BC Ferries reservations cost $17-22 per sailing, $34-44 round trip. For a Tuesday morning crossing that rarely fills up, that's money you don't need to spend. For a Friday 5pm sailing in July, it's probably worth it.

The table below shows actual fill rates so you can decide for yourself.

## How often do Friday sailings fill up?

Friday is the busiest day of the week. Here are the sailings that filled up most often, based on capacity data collected every 15 minutes from BC Ferries over the past 12 weeks.

## When to reserve

- Friday afternoon or evening
- Sunday afternoon or evening
- Long weekends (Family Day, Victoria Day, Canada Day, Labour Day)
- Spring break or Christmas/New Year
- Summer weekends (June through August)
- Any time you have a flight or appointment you can't miss

## When standby is fine

- Tuesday through Thursday
- Mid-morning sailings (10am to 2pm)
- October through April, outside holidays
- Any trip where waiting an extra sailing wouldn't be a big deal

## Reservation rules worth knowing

- **Cancellations:** Full refund if you cancel at least 2 hours before sailing. After that, no refund.
- **Arrival:** Show up at least 30 minutes before departure or your spot may be released to standby.
- **Oversized vehicles:** RVs and trucks with trailers have separate booking from standard vehicles.
- **Booking window:** Reserve online at bcferries.com, usually months in advance.

## Going standby

If you'd rather skip the fee:

1. **Arrive early.** 60-90 minutes before sailing on busy days, 30-45 minutes on quieter ones.
2. **Take an early sailing.** The 7am and 9am departures are almost always lighter than afternoon ones.
3. **Check current capacity.** BC Ferries shows how full upcoming sailings are in real time.
4. **Have a backup.** If you miss one sailing, the next is usually 2 hours later.

## Use the data

If a sailing filled up 8 out of 12 similar days, book a reservation. If it never filled up, save the money.
