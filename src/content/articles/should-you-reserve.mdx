You're booking a trip to Victoria and BC Ferries is asking if you want to add a $22 reservation. That's $44 round trip just to guarantee your spot. Is it worth it, or can you save the money and take your chances?

## What you get with a reservation

- **Guaranteed space** on your chosen sailing
- **No waiting** - drive straight to the reservation lane
- **Peace of mind** - especially important if you're catching a flight or have time-sensitive plans

## What you don't need a reservation for

Many sailings never fill up, especially:

- Mid-week sailings (Tuesday-Thursday)
- Mid-morning departures (10am-2pm)
- Off-season travel (October-April, outside holidays)
- Routes with frequent service

For these sailings, standby works fine and saves you money.

## How to decide: use real data

Rather than guessing, check historical capacity:

1. Visit my [should I reserve tool](/)
2. Enter your route, date, and sailing time
3. See how often that sailing filled up on similar days

For example, if a sailing filled up 4 out of 6 recent similar days, you probably want a reservation. If it never filled up, save your money.

## When to always reserve

**Book a reservation if:**

- Traveling Friday afternoon or Sunday evening
- Going during summer (June-August)
- Traveling on any long weekend
- You're on a tight schedule (flights, events, appointments)
- It's a holiday period (spring break, Christmas)
- There's a major event (concerts, festivals)

## When you can usually skip it

**Standby is fine for:**

- Tuesday-Thursday travel
- Mid-morning sailings
- Fall/winter/spring off-peak times
- Flexible schedules where you can wait for the next sailing

## The standby strategy

If you're comfortable with some uncertainty:

1. **Arrive early** - 60-90 minutes before sailing time
2. **Have a backup plan** - be prepared to wait for the next sailing
3. **Check current conditions** - BC Ferries shows how full upcoming sailings are

Most standby passengers get on their first choice sailing, especially if they arrive early.

## Cost breakdown

Reservation fees by route:

- **Tsawwassen-Swartz Bay / Swartz Bay-Tsawwassen:** $17-22
- **Horseshoe Bay-Departure Bay / Departure Bay-Horseshoe Bay:** $17-22
- **Tsawwassen-Duke Point / Duke Point-Tsawwassen:** $17-22

Add this to your regular fare (vehicle + driver, plus additional passengers).

## My recommendation

Don't guess. Use historical data to make informed decisions.

My [capacity analysis tool](/) shows you real patterns from the past 12 weeks. If a sailing regularly fills up, the reservation is worth it. If it never does, save your money.

Check the Friday 5pm Swartz Bay sailing at my [capacity tracker](/) to see how often it filled up on recent Fridays.

Want to dig deeper? Browse [historical capacity by date](/history) to see exactly how full specific sailings were on past days. Or read [BC Ferries peak travel times](/articles/peak-travel-times) to understand when the system is busiest overall.
