You're looking at the BC Ferries schedule, trying to decide between the 3pm and 5pm Friday sailing to Victoria. One gets you there for dinner, but will it be packed? That choice between convenience and chaos matters.

## When are BC Ferries sailings busiest?

Based on historical capacity data, here are the times when BC Ferries tends to fill up:

### Peak days of the week

**Friday afternoons and evenings** are consistently the busiest time to travel. Many people head to Vancouver Island or the mainland for weekend getaways, and the ferries fill up quickly.

**Sunday afternoons and evenings** see heavy return traffic as weekend travelers head home.

**Monday mornings** can be busy with business travelers and people returning from long weekends.

### Seasonal patterns

**Summer months (June-August)** are peak season. Tourist traffic is at its highest, and even mid-week sailings can fill up during popular times.

**Long weekends** are extremely busy. Victoria Day, Canada Day, BC Day, and Thanksgiving weekends see some of the highest capacity on the system.

**Spring break and Christmas holidays** also see significant increases in traffic.

## Best times to travel

If you want to avoid crowds:

- **Mid-week sailings** (Tuesday-Thursday) are typically quieter
- **Mid-morning sailings** (10am-2pm) on weekdays have good availability
- **Off-season months** (October-April, excluding holidays) offer the most relaxed travel

## How to check if your sailing is likely to be busy

Use my [busiest ferry times tool](/busiest-ferry-times) to see historical capacity data for specific routes and days of the week. You can see which sailings filled up most often over the past 12 weeks.

For a specific date, use the [should I reserve tool](/) to see:
- How often that sailing filled up on similar days
- When it typically reaches capacity
- Whether you should make a reservation

## When to book a reservation

Consider reserving if you're traveling:

- On a Friday afternoon or Sunday evening
- During summer months (June-August)
- On any long weekend
- During school holidays
- To an event (concerts, sporting events, festivals)

Reservations cost $17-22 per vehicle depending on the route, but they guarantee your spot and eliminate wait time at the terminal.

## Pro tips

1. **Check conditions the night before** - BC Ferries publishes current conditions, and you can see if your sailing tends to fill up
2. **Arrive early for busy sailings** - Even if you don't have a reservation, showing up 60-90 minutes early gives you a good shot at standby space
3. **Be flexible** - If you can shift your travel by a few hours, you might find significantly less crowded sailings
