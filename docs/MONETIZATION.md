## Overview

This document outlines the monetization roadmap for BC Ferries Conditions,
phased by traffic milestones. The approach prioritizes UX preservation and
contextual relevance over maximizing ad impressions.

**Current state (Feb 2026):** ~20 users/month, growing. Site recently
fixed canonical tags for Google indexing, expecting organic growth.

**Primary goal:** Side income initially, with the infrastructure to
maximize revenue as traffic scales.

---

## Phase 1: Plant the seed (now, under 500 visitors/month)

### What to do

Add a **donation CTA** linking to Stripe. Keep it simple and non-intrusive.

### Why

Revenue will be negligible at this traffic level. The point is to:

- Establish that the site accepts support
- Test copy and placement without risk
- Build the habit of iterating on monetization

### Placement

1. **Footer** - A persistent "Finding this helpful? Consider supporting
   the project" line with a link, visible on every page.
2. **After results on the homepage** - Once a user has selected a route,
   date, and sailing (and received their answer), show a subtle CTA below
   the results. This is the highest-intent, highest-gratitude moment.

### Copy direction

Keep it casual and honest:

- "Finding this useful? Help keep it running."
- "Built by one person. Support the project."

Avoid guilt-tripping or aggressive asks.

### Expected revenue

$0-10/month. This is fine. The goal is infrastructure, not income.

---

## Phase 2: Earn trust (500 to 5,000 visitors/month)

### What to add

1. **Affiliate links for accommodations**
2. **Email capture** (optional, if capacity allows)

### Affiliate links

Relevant affiliate programs:

| Program           | Commission                 | Fit                                           |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Booking.com       | 25-40% of their commission | Strong - travelers need hotels at destination |
| Airbnb            | $25-50 per first booking   | Strong - same logic                           |
| Travel insurance  | $5-20 per policy           | Moderate - most ferry travelers are local     |
| Gas rewards cards | $50-150 per signup         | Moderate - drivers waiting for ferries        |

**Placement:** Contextual CTAs after showing results, specifically on the
TSA-SWB route (people heading to the island). Example:

> "Staying overnight in Victoria? Find places to stay near the ferry
> terminal."

This feels helpful, not salesy, because it aligns with the user's actual
next step.

**Don't show affiliate CTAs on SWB-TSA** (people heading home to
Vancouver) unless it's for parking or similar.

### Email capture (stretch goal)

A "Get notified when sailings typically fill up" signup. This builds an
owned audience asset that's valuable for:

- Direct engagement
- Future monetization (sponsored newsletter content)
- Traffic retention

**Placement:** Below the DailySummaryTable on the homepage, or on the
busiest-ferry-times pages.

### Expected revenue

- Affiliate: $50-300/month at the high end of this traffic range
- Donations: $5-25/month
- Email list: no direct revenue, but compounds over time

---

## Phase 3: Direct sales (5,000+ visitors/month)

### What to add

**Local business advertising** - selling ad placements directly to
businesses that serve ferry travelers.

### The insight

There are billboards all along Highway 17 from Swartz Bay into Victoria.
Those advertisers (hotels, restaurants, attractions, tour operators) are
paying $2,000-10,000/month for untargeted billboard impressions. This site
can offer them hyper-targeted digital impressions to people actively
planning ferry trips, at a fraction of the cost.

### Value proposition to advertisers

| Billboard                   | This site                                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Seen by everyone driving by | Seen by people actively planning a ferry trip |
| No click tracking           | Full analytics (impressions, clicks)          |
| $2,000-10,000/month         | $50-200/month                                 |
| Static message              | Can be route-specific and seasonal            |

### Pricing tiers

| Tier     | Price   | What they get                                                   |
| -------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Basic    | $50/mo  | Text link in footer or results page                             |
| Standard | $100/mo | Small display ad (logo + tagline) on relevant route pages       |
| Premium  | $200/mo | Prominent placement + category exclusivity (only 1 hotel, etc.) |

Limit to **3-5 advertisers max** to keep the site clean and maintain
exclusivity value.

### Placement

- **After results on the homepage** (below the answer, above the donation CTA)
- **On busiest-ferry-times detail pages** (below the table)
- **Route-specific:** TSA-SWB pages show Victoria/island businesses,
  SWB-TSA pages show Vancouver/Tsawwassen businesses

### Prospecting playbook

Ranked by effort vs. lead quality:

| Approach                       | Effort | Lead quality | How                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------ | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Billboard advertisers          | Low    | High         | Drive Highway 17, photograph and note advertisers    |
| Google Ads reverse engineering | Low    | High         | Search "Victoria hotels", note who's buying ads      |
| Tourism Victoria partners      | Low    | High         | Check their partner directory online                 |
| Ferry terminal businesses      | Low    | Very high    | Restaurants, parking, car rental near terminals      |
| BC Ferries vacation partners   | Low    | High         | Check bcferries.com/vacation-packages                |
| Yelp/TripAdvisor top rated     | Medium | Medium       | Top businesses in Sidney, Brentwood Bay, Victoria    |
| Business associations          | Medium | Medium       | Sidney BIA, Downtown Victoria BA for warm intros     |
| Shuttle/transfer services      | Low    | High         | BC Ferries Connector, hotel shuttles, YYJ transfers  |
| Event organizers               | Medium | Seasonal     | Victoria Fringe, Symphony Splash, Christmas markets  |
| Instagram geotag mining        | Medium | Medium       | Posts geotagged at Swartz Bay / Tsawwassen terminals |

**Start with the top 3** (billboards, Google Ads, Tourism Victoria) to
build a prospect list without much work.

### Prerequisites before reaching out

- Consistent traffic of at least 2-3k/month
- Google Search Console data showing organic growth trend
- A simple one-pager / media kit: traffic stats, audience profile, ad
  placement mockups
- At least one month of Google Analytics data at scale to show

---

## Phase 4: Optimize (10,000+ visitors/month)

### Consider adding

- **Google AdSense** as supplemental income (non-intrusive placements only)
- **A/B testing** on CTA copy and placement
- **Premium features** (sailing alerts, custom notifications)
- **Sponsored newsletter content** (if email list was built in Phase 2)

### AdSense math at scale

| Traffic | RPM (travel niche) | Monthly revenue |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------------- |
| 10k/mo  | $3-8               | $30-80          |
| 25k/mo  | $3-8               | $75-200         |
| 50k/mo  | $3-8               | $150-400        |

AdSense makes sense as a supplement at this level, not as the primary
strategy. Direct local ads will always pay better per impression.

## Revenue projections summary

| Phase   | Traffic   | Donations | Affiliate | Local ads  | AdSense | Total      |
| ------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- |
| Phase 1 | <500/mo   | $0-10     | -         | -          | -       | $0-10      |
| Phase 2 | 500-5k/mo | $5-25     | $50-300   | -          | -       | $55-325    |
| Phase 3 | 5k-10k/mo | $10-50    | $100-500  | $150-600   | -       | $260-1,150 |
| Phase 4 | 10k+/mo   | $10-50    | $100-500  | $300-1,000 | $30-200 | $440-1,750 |

These are rough estimates. Actual numbers depend heavily on conversion
rates, advertiser retention, and traffic quality.
